# CPU32-Assembler

DRAFT - Assembler is in Development.

A C++ Assemble for a custom 32bit CPU design.

The goal was to have the logic for each instruction handled by the "Instruction Object" itself. This allows the opcodes to be changed to suit any architecture.

Inital build works but is still in development but builds a working assembler.
